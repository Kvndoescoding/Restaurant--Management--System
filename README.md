"what if a customer could walk into a restaurant,choose what they want to eat easily,
and pay with a quick scan-all without human help?"
That question created the spark for this project 

**The Beginning: Problems faced by humanity**
  1. Large crowd and long queues
  2. Shortage of staff
  3. Mistakes while taking orders
  4. Inaccurate and inefficient billing systems
I wanted to build a smart,fully autononomous system that solved these problems.

**The vision**
 1. A user friendly Environment
 2. Diplays a beautiful,image-rich menu
 3. Process payments via qr instantly

**Tech behind the magic**
 1. tkinter: the foundation for the entire user interface
 2. PIL: for crisp images
 3. qrcode: quick and seamless payments via QR code generation
 4. pyttsx3: a voice that speaks to the userâ€”literally
 5. os and time: Behind the scenes helpers

**Meet the Interface**
